I was sitting next to my 12-year-old step-daughter while she listened to music on her phone. Apple Music's synchronized lyrics were scrolling across her screen. She was reading along to every word.

That's when I actually *read* what she was reading. The song wasn't tagged explicit. But the lyrics? Let's just say I learned some new vocabulary that day.

Apple Music shows synchronized lyrics for most songs. Your kids can read along as they listen, seeing every word scroll across the screen. That's great for singalongs. It's less great when the lyrics include content you'd rather they not see.

Here's what parents need to know about Apple Music lyrics—and how to handle them.

## How Lyrics Work in Apple Music

When a song plays, users can tap to show lyrics. For most popular songs, Apple displays:

- **Time-synced lyrics** - Words highlight as they're sung
- **Full lyrics** - The complete text of the song
- **Translated lyrics** - Available for many non-English songs

This means your child isn't just *hearing* potentially inappropriate content—they're *reading* it, word by word, in perfect sync.

## The Explicit Tag Doesn't Catch Everything

Apple relies on record labels to tag songs as "Explicit." When you enable Clean mode in Screen Time, songs with that tag are hidden.

But here's the problem: plenty of songs with concerning lyrics don't have the Explicit tag.

**Songs slip through because:**
- Labels are inconsistent about tagging
- Older songs often weren't tagged when uploaded
- International songs may not be tagged at all
- Some labels are simply lenient about what counts as "explicit"

**"Clean" versions have their own issues:**
- Words are bleeped, but themes remain
- Kids can often figure out the censored words
- The context—what the song is actually about—doesn't change

A song about mature themes doesn't become appropriate just because one word is muted.

**What I actually do:** I use SafeTunes to approve specific songs, albums, and artists. My kids use Apple Music normally, but they can only play what I've said yes to. No more worrying about what lyrics are scrolling across their screen.

## What's Actually in Popular Songs

Without naming specific artists, here's content that regularly appears in songs *without* the Explicit tag:

- Sexual references and innuendo
- Drug and alcohol glorification
- Violence and aggressive themes
- Relationship dynamics you might not want modeled

The lyrics feature makes all of this highly visible. Kids aren't just catching fragments—they're reading every word.

## How to Preview Lyrics Before Approving

If you're manually vetting songs for your kids, here's how to check lyrics:

**In Apple Music:**
1. Play the song (or preview it)
2. Tap the lyrics button (quote icon at the bottom)
3. Read through before adding to approved playlists

**Online resources:**
- Genius.com - Comprehensive lyrics database with annotations
- AZLyrics.com - Simple lyrics without extras
- Google - Search "[song name] lyrics"

**Things to look for:**
- Obvious profanity (the easy catch)
- Sexual content and innuendo
- References to drugs, alcohol, violence
- Themes and messages you want to discuss first

## The Time Problem

Here's the reality: manually checking lyrics for every song is exhausting.

Your 12-year-old wants to listen to the current top 40. That's dozens of songs to vet. Each one requires:
1. Finding the song
2. Reading through lyrics
3. Making a decision
4. Repeating for the next song

Multiply this by constantly-changing music tastes, and you've got a part-time job.

## A Better Workflow

Instead of vetting every song individually, consider vetting at the artist level:

**Artists you trust completely** - Approve their entire catalog
- Disney soundtracks
- Kids' music artists
- Artists whose values align with yours

**Artists who need song-by-song review** - Preview before approving
- Current pop artists
- Anything your kids specifically request

**Artists you skip entirely** - Don't even start
- Artists known for explicit content
- Anyone whose catalog would take too long to vet

This reduces your workload significantly while still maintaining control.

## What SafeTunes Offers

With SafeTunes, you can:

**AI lyric analysis** - This is the game-changer. When you're unsure about a song, SafeTunes can analyze the lyrics across 10 content categories: profanity, sexual content, violence, drugs/alcohol, dark themes, crude humor, concerning references, hateful content, religious criticism, and mature concepts. You get an objective breakdown before you approve.

**Approve artists entirely** - Trust Taylor Swift? Her whole catalog is available.

**Approve specific albums** - Want just the Encanto soundtrack, not all Disney music? Done.

**Approve specific songs** - Maximum control for artists you're unsure about.

**Request workflow** - Kids can request songs they want. You get notified and can review lyrics before approving.

**Blocked search visibility** - See what songs and artists your kids tried to search for that weren't approved. Insight into their music interests.

**Multi-kid profiles** - Your 12-year-old's approved music can be completely different from your 5-year-old's.

**Artwork hiding** - Block album covers with inappropriate imagery.

Your kids use the normal Apple Music app. They see lyrics for approved songs. But unapproved songs—with their potentially concerning lyrics—simply don't play.

## Talking to Kids About Lyrics

Even with controls in place, it's worth having conversations about lyrics:

**Why we're careful about music**
- Music shapes how we think and feel
- Lyrics often promote values we don't share
- It's not about "bad words" but bigger messages

**What to do when they hear something concerning**
- Come talk to you about it
- It's okay to ask questions
- You won't be mad—you'd rather discuss it

**Developing their own judgment**
- Help them think critically about what songs are saying
- As they mature, give them more responsibility
- The goal is wisdom, not permanent restriction
