We were at the library last Saturday. My 12-year-old had already grabbed three books and was reaching for a fourth. I recognized the author's name—but I had no idea if the book was appropriate.

I pulled out my phone, opened SafeReads, and scanned the barcode.

Ten seconds later: "Caution — Contains moderate violence and some mature themes. Recommended for ages 14+."

I handed the book back. She found something else.

That's the power of barcode scanning. **Know what's in the book before it leaves the library.**

## How It Works

**Step 1:** Open SafeReads on your phone

**Step 2:** Tap the camera icon and point at the book's barcode (the ISBN on the back cover)

**Step 3:** SafeReads identifies the book and runs AI analysis

**Step 4:** You get a verdict: Safe, Caution, or Warning—plus detailed content breakdown

The whole process takes about 10 seconds. By the time your kid asks "can I get this one?", you already have the answer.

## Why This Changes Everything

### 1. No more "let me look it up later"

Before SafeReads, my options were:
- Say yes without knowing what's in it
- Say "maybe" and research at home (then forget)
- Say no and deal with the disappointment

Now I can give a real answer on the spot. Yes, no, or "let's find something similar that's more appropriate."

### 2. You're not the bad guy

When the AI says "Warning — contains explicit content," you're not the one saying no. You're just reading the report.

"Sorry honey, this one's for older readers. The app says it has some stuff that's not great for 12-year-olds. Let's find another mystery book."

The AI is the messenger. You're just the parent who cares.

### 3. It works on ANY book

Popular bestsellers? Checked.
Obscure series your kid found in the back of the library? Checked.
That book with the cool cover but no reviews online? Checked.

If it has an ISBN barcode, SafeReads can analyze it.

### 4. You catch what ratings miss

Book "age ratings" are almost meaningless. A book labeled "Ages 10+" might be fine—or it might contain graphic violence and sexual content.

SafeReads doesn't rely on publisher ratings. It uses GPT-4o AI to analyze the actual content across 10 categories:

- Violence and dark themes
- Sexual content and romance
- Language and profanity
- Drug and alcohol references
- Mature concepts
- And more

You get the real picture, not the marketing label.

## What You Actually See

When you scan a book, SafeReads gives you:

**The Verdict**
- **Safe** — Go ahead and check it out
- **Caution** — Review the concerns before deciding
- **Warning** — Significant content issues

**The Details**
Each concern is broken down:
- What category (violence, language, etc.)
- Severity (mild, moderate, heavy)
- Specific details about what appears

**Age Recommendation**
Based on the content, not the publisher's marketing.

**Summary**
A quick overview of what the book is about and what content appears.

## Alternative: Cover Photo ID

Can't find the barcode? No problem. Just snap a photo of the book cover.

SafeReads uses image recognition to identify the book, then runs the same AI analysis.

This is perfect for:
- Books without visible barcodes (library stickers covering them)
- Books you see in a friend's house
- Screenshots of book recommendations online

## Real Library Scenarios

**Scenario 1: The popular series everyone's reading**

Your kid's friends are all reading this fantasy series. You've heard mixed things. Scan the first book: "Caution — Moderate violence, some dark themes. Recommended 12+."

Now you can make an informed decision based on your kid's maturity level.

**Scenario 2: The book with the appealing cover**

Your 10-year-old grabs something with a fun, colorful cover. Scan it: "Warning — Contains explicit sexual content, heavy language. Young Adult, recommended 16+."

The cover lied. Glad you checked.

**Scenario 3: The assigned school reading**

The teacher assigned a novel for class. You want to know what's coming. Scan it: "Caution — Deals with mature themes including death and grief. Consider reading alongside your child for discussion."

Now you can prepare for those conversations.

## Beyond the Library

Barcode scanning works everywhere:

- **Bookstores** — Before you buy
- **Book fairs** — Those school book fairs have questionable titles
- **Friends' houses** — "Can I borrow this?"
- **Thrift stores** — No reviews available for that 2003 YA novel

Anywhere there's a book with a barcode, you can get instant content analysis.

## The SafeReads Advisor

Not sure what to look for instead? After scanning a book, you can chat with the SafeReads Advisor.

"My daughter wanted [Book Title] but it's too mature. Can you suggest similar mysteries that are appropriate for a 12-year-old?"

The AI knows your family's values (based on your profile settings) and can recommend alternatives that match.

## The Bottom Line

Library trips used to be stressful. Every book your kid grabbed was a potential landmine of inappropriate content you'd have to deal with later.

Now they're easy. Scan, check, decide. In the time it takes to walk to the checkout desk, you know exactly what's in every book.

That's the difference between hoping for the best and actually knowing.
