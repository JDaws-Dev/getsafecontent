When I became a step-dad, I wanted to be the guy who banned screens entirely. "They'll read books! Play outside! Learn an instrument!"

Then reality hit. My step-daughters—ages 12 and 5—showed me that YouTube isn't all bad. In fact, some of the best educational content available anywhere lives on YouTube—for free. The 12-year-old watches science channels for fun. The 5-year-old has learned more from Numberblocks than I'd ever admit.

The trick is finding the good stuff without exposing them to everything else.
