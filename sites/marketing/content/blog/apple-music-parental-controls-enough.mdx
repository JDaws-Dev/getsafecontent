Apple's parental controls are better than nothing. But are they *enough*?

After years of relying on Apple's built-in restrictions—and watching explicit content slip through anyway—I've learned the answer is: it depends on your family.

Let me break down exactly what Apple offers, where it falls short, and when you might need something more.

## What Apple Offers

Apple provides two layers of parental controls for music:

### Screen Time Content Restrictions

1. Go to **Settings** → **Screen Time** → **Content & Privacy Restrictions**
2. Tap **Content Restrictions** → **Music, Podcasts, News & Workouts**
3. Choose **Clean** instead of **Explicit**

This hides songs tagged as "Explicit" in the Apple Music catalog.

### Family Sharing Controls

If your child has their own Apple ID under Family Sharing, you can:
- Enable Ask to Buy for purchases
- Set content restrictions remotely
- Monitor screen time

Sounds comprehensive, right? Here's the problem.

## The 5 Gaps in Apple's Approach

### 1. It Relies on Record Labels Being Honest

Apple doesn't decide what's explicit—record labels do. If a label doesn't tag a song, Apple won't filter it.

I've found plenty of songs with concerning lyrics that aren't tagged explicit. The system only works when labels are accurate, and they often aren't.

### 2. No Per-Artist Controls

With Apple's system, it's all or nothing. You can't say "Taylor Swift is fine, but this other artist isn't."

Every family has different standards. You might approve of some artists your neighbor wouldn't, and vice versa. Apple doesn't account for this.

### 3. "Clean" Versions Still Have Themes

A "clean" version just bleeps out certain words. The song's themes—violence, sexual content, drug references—remain intact.

A song about topics you'd rather not explain doesn't become appropriate just because one word is muted.

### 4. It Doesn't Work Across Devices

Your restrictions only apply to devices signed into your Apple ID or managed under Family Sharing. If your child:
- Uses a friend's device
- Logs into a school iPad
- Gets a new device you haven't configured

...the restrictions don't follow them.

### 5. Kids Can Work Around It

If your child knows the Screen Time passcode—or figures it out—they can disable restrictions. And let's be honest: kids are resourceful.

## When Apple's Controls ARE Enough

Apple's built-in controls might work for you if:

- Your kids are teenagers who mostly make good choices
- You're okay with some explicit content slipping through
- You just want to reduce exposure, not eliminate it
- You closely monitor what they're listening to anyway

For many families, "good enough" is genuinely good enough.

## When You Need More

Consider additional controls if:

- Your kids are younger (under 12)
- Your family has stricter content standards
- You want to approve specific artists, not just filter explicit tags
- You need controls that work regardless of device
- You want peace of mind, not constant monitoring

## The Approval-Based Alternative

Instead of trying to filter out bad content, what if you could approve only the good content?

That's the approach we took with SafeTunes. Your kids use the real Apple Music app—same interface, same features—but they can only play music you've personally approved.

- Approve Taylor Swift? They get her whole catalog.
- Approve a specific album? Just those songs.
- Something slips through? Remove it with one tap.

It's the difference between hoping a filter catches everything and knowing exactly what's available.

## The Bottom Line

Apple's parental controls are a good starting point. If you haven't set them up, do it now—it takes two minutes and it's free.

But if you want real control over what your kids hear, you need to move beyond filtering to approving. That's the only way to guarantee nothing slips through.
