Apple's built-in parental controls are a decent starting point. But if you're like me—a new step-dad trying to figure out the safest setup for my kids—you might be wondering if there's something better out there.

I've been researching options for my 12-year-old, who's deep into music and has strong opinions about what she listens to. Here's what I found.

## What Apple Offers (And Why It's Not Enough)

Apple's Screen Time lets you toggle "Clean" mode, which hides songs tagged as "Explicit." It's free and built-in, which is great.

But it has limitations:
- Relies on record labels to tag songs accurately (they don't always)
- No way to approve specific artists while blocking others
- "Clean" versions still have mature themes—just with words bleeped out
- Your settings only work on devices you control

For a lot of families, that's not enough control.

## The Options Worth Considering

### 1. Apple Screen Time (Free)

**What it does:** Blocks explicit-tagged content across Apple Music.

**Pros:**
- Free and built into iOS/macOS
- Easy to set up
- Works with Family Sharing

**Cons:**
- All-or-nothing approach
- Misses untagged explicit content
- No per-artist controls
- Kids can work around it if they know the passcode

**Best for:** Families who want basic filtering without additional cost.

### 2. Bark ($14/month)

**What it does:** Monitors device activity and alerts parents to concerning content.

**Pros:**
- Comprehensive monitoring across apps
- Alerts for concerning patterns
- Works on multiple platforms

**Cons:**
- Monitoring, not blocking—kids still see content before you're alerted
- Doesn't prevent exposure, just reports it
- Some families uncomfortable with surveillance approach

**Best for:** Parents of teens who want visibility without heavy-handed blocking.

### 3. Qustodio ($55/year)

**What it does:** General parental control suite with web filtering, screen time, and app blocking.

**Pros:**
- Cross-platform (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac)
- App blocking and time limits
- Location tracking

**Cons:**
- Not music-specific—can't approve individual songs or artists
- Best at blocking apps entirely, not curating content within apps
- Can be complex to configure

**Best for:** Families wanting broad device control, not music-specific filtering.

### 4. SafeTunes ($4.99/month)

**What it does:** Lets kids use the real Apple Music app, but only play songs, albums, and artists you've approved.

**Pros:**
- Approval-based (you choose what's allowed, not what's blocked)
- AI lyric analysis across 10 content categories to help you evaluate songs
- Approve at artist, album, or song level—your choice
- Multi-kid profiles with different approvals for each child
- Request workflow—kids request, you approve with one tap
- Blocked search monitoring so you see what they tried to find
- Artwork hiding for inappropriate album covers
- Kids use the same Apple Music interface
- Works regardless of which device they're on

**Cons:**
- Monthly cost
- Requires initial setup to approve content

**Best for:** Families who want complete control over exactly what their kids hear.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Apple Screen Time | Bark | Qustodio | SafeTunes |
|---------|------------------|------|----------|-----------|
| Blocks explicit tags | Yes | No (monitoring) | No | N/A (whitelist) |
| Per-artist control | No | No | No | Yes |
| AI lyric analysis | No | No | No | Yes |
| Multi-kid profiles | Limited | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Request workflow | No | No | No | Yes |
| Approval-based | No | No | No | Yes |
| Music-specific | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| Monthly cost | Free | $14 | $4.60 | $4.99 |

## My Recommendation

**If you just want basic filtering:** Use Apple's built-in Screen Time. It's free and catches the obvious stuff.

**If you want visibility into teen behavior:** Consider Bark's monitoring approach.

**If you want complete control over what's available:** An approval-based approach like SafeTunes is the only way to guarantee your kids only hear what you've said yes to.

For my family, I needed something in between "block everything explicit" and "hope for the best." Being able to approve Taylor Swift while still reviewing other artists gave me the flexibility I needed.
