My 12-year-old was scrolling through Apple Music when I glanced at her screen. The album cover she was looking at made me do a double-take.

The song itself was approved—we'd checked the lyrics. But that album cover? Let's just say it wasn't something I wanted her staring at while she listened.

Here's the thing: **Apple Music has no way to hide album artwork.**

You can block explicit songs. You can enable "Clean" mode. But album covers? They're always visible, no matter how inappropriate they might be.

## The Album Art Problem

Album artwork has gotten increasingly explicit over the years. What you'll find on covers today:

- **Suggestive imagery** - Poses and outfits that push boundaries
- **Violence** - Graphic depictions, weapons, blood
- **Drug references** - Pills, smoke, paraphernalia
- **Crude imagery** - Things that belong nowhere near kids' screens
- **Disturbing visuals** - Horror-style artwork, dark themes

And here's the frustrating part: a song can be tagged "Clean" while its album cover is anything but.

## Why Apple Doesn't Offer This

Apple's parental controls focus on audio content:
- Explicit song tags
- Clean/Explicit toggle
- Content restrictions

But they completely ignore the visual side. There's no "Clean artwork" setting. No way to blur inappropriate covers. No option to hide specific albums from view.

If your child searches for or browses music, they're going to see whatever album art comes up. Period.

## What I Actually Use

This is exactly why I built artwork hiding into SafeTunes.

With SafeTunes, you have two options:

### Option 1: Hide Specific Album Covers

See an album with a problematic cover? Hide it with one tap. The album's songs still play normally—only the artwork is hidden, replaced with a neutral placeholder.

This is perfect when:
- The music is fine but the cover isn't
- You've approved an artist but not all their album art
- Your kids discovered something that needs hiding

### Option 2: Global Artwork Hide

Want to remove all album artwork entirely? One toggle and every album cover is hidden across the entire app.

This works great for:
- Younger kids who don't need to see any covers
- Families who want zero visual distractions
- Simplified, clean listening experience

## How It Works in Practice

**Scenario 1: You're approving new music**

Your 12-year-old requests a new album. You check the lyrics—they're fine. But the album cover shows more skin than you're comfortable with.

With SafeTunes: Approve the album, tap "Hide Artwork." Done. She listens to the music; she doesn't see the cover.

**Scenario 2: You notice something after the fact**

Your kid is listening to approved music when you notice an album cover you missed during approval.

With SafeTunes: Open the parent dashboard, find the album, hide the artwork. Takes 5 seconds.

**Scenario 3: You want a clean slate**

You don't want to evaluate every album cover individually. You just want music without the visual noise.

With SafeTunes: Enable "Global Hide Artwork" in settings. Every cover is hidden, everywhere in the app.

## The Visual Side of Music Safety

We talk a lot about lyrics—and rightly so. Kids absorb messages through the words they hear.

But they also absorb messages through images. An album cover your child sees 50 times while listening shapes their sense of what's normal, acceptable, attractive.

Hiding inappropriate artwork isn't about being overprotective. It's about controlling the full experience, not just the audio half.

## Why This Feature Matters

**It's not just about explicit covers.** Sometimes artwork is:
- Distracting during homework time
- Scary for younger siblings
- Simply not aligned with your family's values

Having the option to hide it—per album or globally—gives you flexibility no other solution offers.

## The Bottom Line

Apple Music parental controls ignore album artwork entirely. That's a gap.

SafeTunes fills it. Per-album hiding for surgical control, or global hiding for complete simplicity. Your choice.

Because what your kids see matters just as much as what they hear.
