If you're a parent who uses Apple Music, you've probably wondered: *How do I make sure my kids aren't listening to explicit songs?*

It's a valid concern. Apple Music has over 100 million songs, and a good chunk of them contain explicit lyrics that you probably don't want your 8-year-old hearing.

The good news? Apple does offer some built-in parental controls. The bad news? They have some significant limitations that many parents don't discover until it's too late.

Let me walk you through everything you need to know.

## Apple's Built-In Parental Controls

Apple provides a content restrictions feature through Screen Time. Here's how to set it up:

### On iPhone/iPad:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Screen Time**
2. Tap **Content & Privacy Restrictions**
3. Turn on **Content & Privacy Restrictions**
4. Tap **Content Restrictions** → **Music, Podcasts, News & Workouts**
5. Select **Clean**

### On Mac:
1. Open **System Settings** → **Screen Time**
2. Click **Content & Privacy**
3. Turn on **Content & Privacy**
4. Click **Store Restrictions**
5. Set Music to **Clean**

This tells Apple Music to hide songs marked as "Explicit" in the Apple Music catalog.

## The Problem with Apple's Approach

Here's what Apple doesn't tell you upfront:

**1. It relies on record labels being honest**

Apple's explicit tags come from the record labels themselves. If a label doesn't mark a song as explicit, it won't be filtered—even if the lyrics are inappropriate.

**2. "Clean" versions aren't always clean**

Many "clean" versions of songs just bleep out certain words. The themes, innuendo, and context remain. A song about topics you'd rather not explain to your 7-year-old doesn't become kid-friendly just because one word is muted.

**3. It's all or nothing**

You either block ALL explicit content or allow ALL of it. There's no way to say "I trust Taylor Swift but not this other artist." Every family is different, and a blanket filter doesn't account for that.

**4. Kids are resourceful**

If your child knows the passcode (or figures it out), they can disable restrictions. And if they're using a friend's device? Your settings don't apply.

## A Better Approach: Approve What They Listen To

What if instead of trying to block the bad stuff, you could simply approve the good stuff?

That's the approach we took when building SafeTunes.

With SafeTunes, your child uses the real Apple Music app—same interface, same features—but they can only play songs, albums, or artists that you've approved in advance.

- **You approve Taylor Swift?** They can listen to her entire catalog.
- **You approve a specific playlist?** Only those songs are available.
- **Something slips through?** Remove it with one tap.

It's the difference between a filter that *tries* to catch bad content and a whitelist that *only allows* good content.

## Which Approach Is Right for Your Family?

If your kids are teenagers and you just want to reduce explicit content exposure, Apple's built-in controls might be enough.

But if you have younger kids—or if you want complete peace of mind knowing *exactly* what they're listening to—a whitelist approach gives you that control.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Apple's Controls | SafeTunes |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Blocks explicit-tagged songs | Yes | N/A (whitelist) |
| Catches untagged explicit content | No | Yes |
| Lets you approve specific artists | No | Yes |
| Works across all devices | Only on your devices | Yes |
| Monthly cost | Free | $4.99/mo |

## The Bottom Line

Apple's parental controls are better than nothing. If you haven't set them up yet, go do it now—it takes two minutes.

But if you want real control over what your kids are listening to, you need to flip the model. Instead of blocking the bad, approve the good.

That's what we built SafeTunes to do.
